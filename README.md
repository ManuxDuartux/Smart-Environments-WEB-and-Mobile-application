# Smart Environment WEB and Mobile application
---
I developed a web and mobile platform to create and simulate smart environments (e.g., home, workplace, public spaces), allowing users to define and customize scenarios, associate multiple users, and manage individual comfort preferences. 
The system then automatically computes optimal actuator settings for a given time period, handling conflicting preferences through user hierarchies and device safety constraints (e.g., HVAC, heaters, fans), 
with an AI-driven approach to make the solution more dynamic and predictive.
